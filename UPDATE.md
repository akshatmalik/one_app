entry below is one run. Newest entries first.

## 2026-06-08 00:00 — Games Tab — Tonight's Pick

**Files**: app/apps/game-analytics/lib/calculations.ts, app/apps/game-analytics/components/TonightsPick.tsx, app/apps/game-analytics/page.tsx, app/apps/game-analytics/data/whats-new.json
**Risk**: not risky

Added a "Tonight's Pick" wizard that solves the most common daily dilemma: what should I actually play right now? A new banner prompt on the Games tab opens a two-step sheet — pick your available time (30 min / 1 hr / 2 hr / 4 hr+) then your mood (Anything / Chill / Story / Action / Competitive) — and instantly surfaces your top 3 library picks with specific, human-readable reasons: active streaks to protect, queue position, session-length fit, how long a game has been waiting, and mood/genre match. The #1 pick is expanded by default with a prominent "Play" button; tapping it opens the game's detail sheet for a quick check-in.

FOLLOW-UP: Could add "Recently played" filtering (hide games played in the last hour) and a "surprised me!" short-cut that runs with random time/mood for serendipity.

## 2026-06-01 06:00 — Game Detail — Head-to-Head Game Comparison

**Files**: app/apps/game-analytics/components/GameCompareModal.tsx, app/apps/game-analytics/components/GameBottomSheet.tsx, app/apps/game-analytics/page.tsx, app/apps/game-analytics/data/whats-new.json
**Risk**: not risky

Added a head-to-head comparison modal accessible from the game detail bottom sheet via a new ⇄ button. Users pick any second game from their library through a searchable list, then see a full side-by-side stats table (price, hours, rating, cost-per-hour, ROI, sessions) with per-category winner highlighting, a recharts RadarChart plotting both games across five normalised axes, and an overall verdict. Relationship status cards for each game are shown at the bottom.

FOLLOW-UP: Could add a "swap games" button to quickly flip which game is game1/game2, or persist recent comparison pairs.

## 2026-06-01 00:00 — Stats Tab — What-If Simulator

**Files**: app/apps/game-analytics/lib/calculations.ts, app/apps/game-analytics/components/WhatIfSimulator.tsx, app/apps/game-analytics/components/StatsView.tsx
**Risk**: not risky

Added an interactive "Alternate Reality Simulator" to the Stats tab with four thought-provoking scenarios: skipping impulse buys, never buying games you later abandoned, completing your backlog, and buying on sale vs. full price. Each scenario shows a before/after stat comparison, the specific games affected (with thumbnails), and a punchy insight tailored to the user's data. Users with messy buying habits will see high-impact warnings; users with clean habits get positive confirmation.

FOLLOW-UP: Could add a 5th scenario — "only bought games rated 7+" — showing the hypothetical quality-filtered library.

## 2026-05-22 18:00 — Games Tab — Game search bar

**Files**: app/apps/game-analytics/page.tsx
**Risk**: not risky

Added a full-width search bar to the Games tab that filters by name, genre, platform, franchise, and notes. Shows a live result count ("3 of 42 games") while typing, an X to clear, and a helpful empty state with a "Clear search" link when no games match. Users with large libraries can now find any game instantly without scrolling.

FOLLOW-UP: Consider adding keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl+K) to focus the search bar, and optionally persist the search query across tab switches.

## 2026-05-22 14:00 — Infrastructure — Bootstrap update logs surface

**Files**: UPDATE.md, app/apps/game-analytics/data/whats-new.json, app/apps/game-analytics/components/WhatsNewModal.tsx, app/apps/game-analytics/page.tsx
**Risk**: not risky

Bootstrapped the continuous-improvement loop: created this log file, a
user-facing `whats-new.json` data file, a "What's New" modal, and a header
button to open it. The cron agent will append to both `UPDATE.md` (technical,
this file) and `whats-new.json` (user-friendly) each run.

FOLLOW-UP: First feature-loop run should pick the highest-value improvement.
