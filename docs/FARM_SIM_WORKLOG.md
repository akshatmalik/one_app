# Farm Sim — Work Log

> **Purpose:** Session-by-session + feature-by-feature record of what was built. Any agent resuming work should read this first, then `FARM_SIM_REALTIME_PLAN.md` for the full spec.

---

## How to Resume

1. Read this log (bottom = most recent).
2. Read `docs/FARM_SIM_REALTIME_PLAN.md` for the full spec.
3. Check current branch: `git branch` — should be `claude/farming-sim-plan-p17jtc`.
4. Run `npm run dev` (or `npx next build` to verify clean build).
5. Pick up at the **Next Up** section of the latest session.

## Game Overview (for fast context)

**Farm Sim v2** — real-time farming game inside `app/apps/farm-sim/`.

- Pure simulation engine in `lib/engine/` — crops, weather, water network, market, `endDay()`. **Untouched by UI work.**
- Real-time layer being built in `lib/realtime/` — clock, player movement, stamina.
- Rendering moves from DOM grid → HTML5 `<canvas>` with pixel-art sprite atlas.
- Still mobile-portrait-first; lives in the One App hub at `/apps/farm-sim`.

**Build phases (R0→R5):**
| Phase | What | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| R0 | Palette + sprite atlas + canvas world render + camera + day-tint | ✅ Done |
| R1 | Farmer sprite + movement + tools + hold-to-repeat | ✅ Done |
| R2 | Clock, stamina, sleep → endDay, v1-save migrator | ⏳ Pending |
| R3 | Live weather + lighting | ⏳ Pending |
| R4 | Realism pass — poses, sway, FX, shadows | ⏳ Pending |
| R5 | Balance retune + fun test | ⏳ Pending |

## Sessions

### Session 1 — 2026-07-14

**Agent:** Claude Sonnet 4.6
**Branch:** `claude/farming-sim-plan-p17jtc`
**Goal:** R0 — palette, sprite atlas pipeline, terrain/water/crop sprites, GameCanvas rendering existing farm with camera and day-tint.

#### Features Built

**F1 — Palette** (`render/sprites/palette.ts`)
32-colour earthy ramp: soil (dry/wet), grass/foliage, water/sky, stone, wood, crop tints, outline neutrals. Single source of truth — every sprite maps to palette keys, so colour tweaks are one-line edits.

**F2 — Sprite utilities** (`render/sprites/spriteUtil.ts`)
`sprite()` helper: parses a template-literal pixel grid into `SpriteGrid { w, h, pixels[][] }`. Strips common indentation so sprites can live inside indented source. Human-readable, fully diffable.

**F3 — Terrain sprites** (`render/sprites/tiles.ts`)
16×16 sprites for: grass ×3 variants (visual scatter), tilled-dry (warm soil rows), tilled-wet (darker + sheen row — this IS the moisture UI), locked hedge, reservoir TL, channel-H, channel-V, well. All authored as palette-key pixel grids in TS.

**F4 — Crop sprites** (`render/sprites/crops.ts`)
6 crops × 4 growth stages (seedling/sprout/growing/mature) + withered sprite. Wheat: golden ear heads. Potato: underground mass + foliage. Beans: climbing vine + pods. Tomato: tall vine + hanging reds. Berries: bush + blue clusters. Pumpkin: spreading vines + orange bulge.

**F5 — Atlas builder** (`render/atlas.ts`)
Packs all named sprites into one offscreen canvas at boot. `drawSprite(ctx, name, dx, dy, scale)` for fast blits. Cached singleton; `resetAtlas()` for hot-reload. No binary files in repo.

**F6 — Camera** (`render/camera.ts`)
World-pixel coordinate system. `TILE_PX = 32` (16px sprite × 2 scale). `makeCamera`, `clampCamera`, `centerOnFarm`, `worldToScreen`, `tileToWorld`. R0 centers on farm; R1 will follow player.

**F7 — Lighting** (`render/lighting.ts`)
Time-of-day colour-grade overlay. Four buckets: dawn (warm amber), day (subtle warm tint), dusk (orange-red), night (dark blue). Applied via `globalCompositeOperation: source-atop`. R0 uses `'day'`; full cycle wired in R3.

**F8 — World renderer** (`render/worldRenderer.ts`)
Layered draw: (1) ground tiles via offscreen cache (invalidated only on tile-kind or moisture change — cheap rerenders), (2) y-sorted objects layer (channels, well, reservoir, crops), (3) selection highlight, (4) lighting overlay. Crops anchor bottom-centre and offset up 8px for depth.

**F9 — GameCanvas component** (`components/GameCanvas.tsx`)
React wrapper: rAF render loop (pure draw, no update logic in R0), `ResizeObserver` for responsive sizing, pointer-down → tile index → `onSelect`. Multi-select set drawn as yellow outline batch. `image-rendering: pixelated` for crisp pixel art.

**F10 — Wire into page.tsx**
Replaced `FarmGrid` import with `GameCanvas`. Same props interface — drop-in swap. All v1 controls (TileSheet, BulkActionBar, BuildPanel, MarketPanel, End Day) still work unchanged.

---

#### Decisions Made This Session

- Work log format: session + feature entries, designed for multi-agent resumability.
- R0 scope: render the existing v1 game state on canvas — no behavior change, v1 controls stay working underneath.
- Grid stays 12×12 for R0 (the 12→16 question deferred to after the migrator exists per the plan).
- `TILE_PX = 32` (16px sprites drawn at 2× scale) — good phone density, crisp pixels.
- Ground cache keyed on `kind:moisture-bin` per tile — moisture ≥40 = 'wet'. This makes watering visually immediate.
- Channel bitmask auto-connect deferred to R4; R0 picks H vs V by checking left/right neighbours.

### Session 2 — 2026-07-14

**Agent:** Claude Sonnet 4.6
**Branch:** `claude/farming-sim-plan-p17jtc`
**Goal:** R1 — Farmer character, WASD movement, 20×20 world, tools.

#### Features Built

**F11 — 20×20 world** (`lib/balance.ts`)
`GRID_SIZE` raised 12→20. `START_PLOT` updated to 7×7 centre plot (`r0:7,c0:7,r1:13,c1:13`). `RESERVOIR_POS` moved to `{r:7, c:10}` (north edge centre). `actions.ts` `expansionRing()` was hard-coding 12 — replaced with `GRID_SIZE` import. World is now 640×640 world-pixels (20 × 32px tiles).

**F12 — Farmer sprites** (`render/sprites/farmer.ts`)
12 palette-key pixel grids at 12×18 px each: 4 directions × (idle + walk0 + walk1). Down/up face toward/away camera; left/right arms offset per direction. Walk frames shift leg positions to animate stride. Exported as `FARMER_SPRITES` record for atlas packing.

**F13 — Atlas update** (`render/atlas.ts`)
Cell size raised to 20×20 to accommodate farmer's 12×18 footprint (tile sprites are 16×16). Sprite UVs now store actual `grid.w × grid.h` dimensions (not fixed cell size) so farmer and tile sprites blit at correct sizes. `FARMER_SPRITES` added to `collectSprites()`.

**F14 — Player state** (`lib/realtime/player.ts`)
`PlayerState` interface: pixel position (x/y), facing direction, walkFrame/walkTick/isMoving, current tool, waterCharges. `makePlayer()` starts centred on the 20×20 world. `facingTileIdx()` and `standingTileIdx()` helpers. `WALK_SPEED=2.5`, `RUN_SPEED=4.0` (tiles/sec). `CAN_MAX_CHARGES=5`. No React imports — held in `useRef`.

**F15 — Input handler** (`lib/realtime/input.ts`)
Plain mutable `InputState` object. `attachKeyboard()` binds WASD + arrow keys + Z/Enter (action) + Shift (run). Returns cleanup function for `useEffect`. No `e.repeat` re-fires.

**F16 — Tool→action mapper** (`lib/realtime/interact.ts`)
`toolToAction(player, state, selectedCrop)` maps current tool + facing tile kind to a `PlayerAction`. hoe→till, can→water (if charges>0), seeds→plant (if crop selected), hand→harvest (mature only), builder→null (handled by overlay panel).

**F17 — World renderer update** (`render/worldRenderer.ts`)
`RenderOptions.player?: PlayerState` added. Player blit y-sorted with other objects using feet-world-y. Facing tile highlight now follows player when present (replaces click-selection highlight). Selection highlight parameter kept for backward compat.

**F18 — GameCanvas rewrite** (`components/GameCanvas.tsx`)
- Removed pointer→tile `onSelect` prop; replaced with `onAction`, `onToolChange`, `onPlayerMove`.
- `useRef` holds `PlayerState`, `InputState`, `Camera` — no React re-renders per frame.
- Fixed-timestep loop: accumulates real dt, steps simulation at 1/60s, caps spike at 100ms.
- `updatePlayer()`: reads input, applies velocity, normalises diagonal (×0.7071), per-axis collision via `collidesWithTiles()` (hitbox 16×16 at feet), walk-frame toggle every 8 ticks.
- `collidesWithTiles()`: locked + reservoir tiles are solid; all others walkable. World edges block movement.
- Camera smooth-follow: lerp factor 0.08, clamped to world bounds.
- Action button (Z/Enter): fires `toolToAction` on facing tile, hold-to-repeat with 30-frame initial delay then 12-frame repeat.
- Q/E keys cycle tool left/right through `['hand','hoe','can','seeds','builder']`.
- Canvas tap: detects facing direction toward tapped tile, fires tool action if it's the facing tile.

**F19 — ToolBar component** (`components/ToolBar.tsx`)
5-button row (hand/hoe/can/seeds/builder) with active highlight ring. Watering can shows `n/5` charge counter below icon. Icons + labels readable at small mobile size.

**F20 — Page rewrite** (`page.tsx`)
- Removed mode tabs (farm/build/market). Market and Build are now overlays.
- Bottom action bar: Market button, Tile Info button (visible when facing actionable tile), End Day button.
- Seeds picker strip appears below ToolBar when seeds tool is active — shows emoji + quantity per crop, highlights selected crop.
- Build panel slides in as overlay when builder tool active.
- Market panel is a full-screen overlay.
- `onPlayerMove` callback lifts player position for facing-tile HUD logic.

#### Decisions Made

- Farmer sprite cell 12×18 (not 16×16) — taller than square gives human proportions at 2× display (24×36 px). Fits in 20px atlas cell.
- Collision: locked + reservoir tiles are solid; well and channel are walkable (player wades through). This keeps watering channels accessible on foot.
- Water charges tracked in both `PlayerState.waterCharges` (for render/logic) and mirrored up via `onPlayerMove` for the ToolBar UI — avoids threading GameState down into the realtime layer.
- `selectedIdx` / `multiSelect` / `BulkActionBar` removed from main page flow — superseded by WASD approach. `TileSheet` still accessible via "Tile Info" button for power users.
- `FarmGrid` component still present but no longer used by page.tsx (legacy, can delete in R2).

#### Next Up — R2 (Clock, stamina, sleep)

- [ ] `lib/realtime/clock.ts` — in-game 6 AM–10 PM clock, 1 real-second = ~6 game-minutes
- [ ] `lib/realtime/stamina.ts` — 100/day pool, per-action costs (till=2, water=1, harvest=1, plant=1), visual fatigue at <20
- [ ] Auto-endDay when player walks to bed / clock hits 10 PM
- [ ] Watering-can refill when player stands on reservoir or channel tile
- [ ] `components/Joystick.tsx` — virtual left-thumb joystick for mobile (touch events)
- [ ] `components/ActionButton.tsx` — large A button bottom-right, fires tool on facing tile
- [ ] Run button (B) for mobile
- [ ] v1-save migrator: detect old 12×12 save, reset grid to 20×20 newGame
